Node JS
1. Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run on Windows, 
Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment.
2. Node.js uses JavaScript on the server.
3. Node.js also provides a rich library of various JavaScript modules which simplifies 
the development of web applications using Node.js to a great extent.

What Can Node.js Do
Node.js can generate dynamic page content
Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server
Node.js can collect form data
Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database

What is a Node.js File?
Node.js files contain tasks that will be executed on certain events
A typical event is someone trying to access a port on the server
Node.js files have extension ".js"

Features of Node.js
Following are some of the important features that make Node.js the first choice of software architects.
1. Asynchronous and Event Driven − All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, 
that is, non-blocking. It essentially means a 
Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data. 
The server moves to the next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events 
of Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call.
2. Very Fast − Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in code execution.
3. Single Threaded but Highly Scalable − Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. 
Event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests. 
Node.js uses a single threaded program and the same program can provide service to a much larger number of requests than traditional servers like Apache HTTP Server.
4. No Buffering − Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.
